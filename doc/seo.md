1. I learned to keep search intent in mind when developing a website. A blog I read said there are 4 common types of searches, informational, navigational, commerical, and transactional. Knowing this, developers should think of how they will satisfy that intent with their page content. I learned that good SEO will often do better than paid advertisements which I found interesting. I learned about the capabailities of google analytics. It can track user session duration, pages per session, other things. I also learned about "White hat" vs "Black hat" SEO practices, the first are practices to get good SEO using practices that abide by the rules and the later are practices that exploit the way search engines work. 


2. I think the farming retreat website I developed would fall under the commerical search intent, someone who is searching for a service but is undecided. As result, my website should have the words "farming retreat" in it's meta title / description. Here are example meta titles / descriptions.

    - Title "Blissful Farming Retreat"
    -  Description "Blissful farming retreat located in Seattle has been providing retreats for over 20 years."   

In addition to having "farming retreat" in the meta title / description, I would also have "farming retreat" early in my page content. A small change I would make is auditing my website's usage of H1 tags because I know they're dupliactes and there shouldn't be for better SEO. Lastly, I would use Google analytics to understand how my site is being by used and make modifications to adjust to what I think would better serve users.
